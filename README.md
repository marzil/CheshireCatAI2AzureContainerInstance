# Cheshire Cat AI and Integration with Azure Container Instance

Many people know me and know that I am a supporter of Piero Savastano, mainly because I believe in the project, which seems to be very well done.

Despite this, the project, although well-developed and well-supported by the community, suffers from problems that limit its enterprise use or at least a more secure cloud usage.

To make the infrastructure more secure, I decided to implement these scripts that can also help a novice install the Docker container within a more secure Azure infrastructure.

The operation is not simple, as Azure and Microsoft do not assist us in this, except through some customized scripts that you will find in this repository. Therefore, if you have any suggestions to improve the procedure or architecture, I am open to any advice or assistance.

From here, happy working.
