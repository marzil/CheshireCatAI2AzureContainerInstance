# Cheshire Cat AI and Integration with Azure Container Instance
Many people know me and are aware of my strong support for Piero Savastano. This is not only because I firmly believe in his project, but also because I consider it a prime example of excellence in the tech sector, designed with great care and expertise.

However, even the most well-crafted projects can encounter challenges, particularly when it comes to enterprise scalability and cloud security. These are real obstacles that require practical solutions to ensure our work can thrive and adapt to the demands of the modern business environment.

To address these issues, I have developed a series of scripts aimed at enhancing infrastructure security. The goal is to make installing Docker containers on Azure not only accessible but also more secure, even for beginners. These tools enable you to seamlessly integrate your containers into a robust and secure Azure infrastructure.

It is important to note that this process is not without its difficulties, especially considering that Azure and Microsoft do not provide direct assistance in this area, except through highly customized scripts. However, you will find all the necessary resources in this repository. Your collaboration is vital, and I am more than open to receiving suggestions for further improving procedures and the overall architecture.

I wish everyone good luck and a constructive experience in implementing these solutions.
